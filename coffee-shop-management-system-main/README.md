# Coffee Shop Management System

## Project Overview
The Coffee Shop Management System is a Django-based web application designed to assist in the management of day-to-day operations in a coffee shop. This application provides features for handling inventory, tracking sales, managing customer information, and generating reports, making it a comprehensive solution for coffee shop owners.

## Installation

To set up the Coffee Shop Management System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee_shop.git
   cd coffee_shop
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Django:**
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Run the migrations:**
   After installing Django, set up the database with the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the server:**
   Finally, you can start the server to run your application:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
After starting the server, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser to access the Coffee Shop Management System. You can interact with the application to manage inventory, customer data, and view sales reports.
